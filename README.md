# silkr-mouse-smoothing-pc-reupload
Silkr is an application that smoothes out the cursor movement based on the user input, in this case; a mouse, touchpad, or stylus.

Silkr is a personal project after I graduated high school.
I no longer work on this.
Comments are almost non-existent. I do regret.
